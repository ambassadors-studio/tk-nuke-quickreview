configuration:

    width:
        type: int
        description: The quicktime resolution width

    height:
        type: int
        description: The quicktime resolution height
        
    movie_template:
        type: template
        required_fields: [name, iteration]
        optional_fields: []
        description: The location where the output quicktime will be written to. The two fields
                     name and iteration will be populated. Iteration is an integer number which 
                     will be automatically calculated based on the existing files on disk. Name
                     is typically derived from the name of the current scene.
                     
    current_scene_template:
        type: template
        required_fields: [name]
        optional_fields: "*"
        description: Template that will be used to get the name of the current scene. The only 
                     part of the file name that we are interested in is the name, so any other 
                     fields that may be defined are irrelevant here.
                     
    post_hooks:
        type: list
        allows_empty: true
        values:
            type: hook
            parameters: [mov_path, version_id, comments] 
        description: List of hooks that runs after a quickdaily has been rendered and 
                     uploaded to Shotgun. Parameters passed to the hook are 
                     mov_path, version_id and comments.
